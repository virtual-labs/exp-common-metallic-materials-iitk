1.	<b>Selection of the sample</b>- Select a representative sample that accurately depicts the material's unique microstructural characteristics. Based on the needs of the analysis, the dimensions and form of the sample are to be taken into consideration.<br>
2.	<b>Sectioning</b>- Section the sample using a precision cutting machine. The sections are ought to be divided perpendicularly to the interest areas. Use a coolant or lubricant when cutting to avoid overheating and sample damage.<br>
3.	<b>Mounting</b>- Insert the divided sample into a mounting substance (often a thermosetting resin) to sustain and uphold the specimen's integrity in the ensuing stages. Make sure the sample is oriented correctly to get the analysis plane desired.<br>
4.	<b>Grinding</b>- Using abrasive papers or grinding stones, coarsely grind the mounted sample to get rid of extra material and create a smooth, even surface. To improve the surface finish, use finer abrasive sheets.<br>
5.	<b>Polishing</b>- To achieve a mirror-like surface, polish the sample with polishing papers of varying grit sizes to eliminate scratches and grinding marks. For the last stages of polishing, use a polishing cloth dipped in a polishing suspension (usually alumina or colloidal silica).<br>
6.	<b>Etching</b>- Different etchants are required for different metals and alloys. The etching procedures for commonly used alloys are summarized below.<br>
<b>Aluminum (Al) Alloys</b><br>
<b>•	Purpose:</b> Reveal grain boundaries, precipitates, and phase distribution.<br>
<b>•	Etchant:</b> Keller’s reagent- 95 mL H₂O + 2.5 mL HNO₃ + 1.5 mL HCl + 1 mL HF<br>
<b>•	Procedure:</b> Immerse in Keller’s reagent for 5–10 s and rinse with distilled water and dry.<br>
<b>Brass (Cu-Zn Alloys)</b><br>
<b>•	Purpose:</b> Highlight grain structure and phase separation (α, β phases).<br>
<b>•	Etchant:</b> Ferric chloride solution- FeCl3 + HCl + water<br>
<b>•	Procedure:</b> Immerse in FeCl3 solution for 5–20 s (depending on alloy composition). and rinse with water and ethanol.<br>
<b>Bronze (Cu-Sn Alloys)</b><br>
<b>•	Purpose:</b> Reveal grain boundaries, α and δ phases, and inclusions.<br>
<b>•	Etchant:</b> Ammonium persulfate (5 g in 100 mL water)<br>
<b>•	Procedure:</b> Etch briefly (5–30 s) until microstructure is visible. Rinse with water and ethanol, and then dry.<br>

<b>Titanium (Ti) and Ti Alloys</b><br>
<b>•	Purpose:</b> Highlight α and β phases, twins, and grain structure.<br>
<b>•	Etchant:</b> Kroll’s reagent- 2–3 mL HF + 5–10 mL HNO₃ + 92–93 mL H₂O<br>
<b>•	Procedure:</b> Immerse in Kroll’s reagent for 5–15 s (short immersion to avoid over-etching). Rinse thoroughly in water, followed by alcohol, and dry.<br> 
7.	<b>Rinsing and drying</b>- To get rid of any last bits of debris or etchant, thoroughly rinse the polished and etched sample with water or an appropriate solvent. Use a gentle, lint-free cloth or a stream of air to dry the specimen.<br>
8.	<b>Mount removal</b>- If required, use a heated mount remover or an appropriate solvent to remove the mounting material.<br>
9.	<b>Final cleaning</b>- Use a mild detergent or solvent to clean the sample and get rid of any leftover contaminants. Ensure the sample is completely dry before examining the specimen under a microscope.<br>
10.	<b>Microscopic examination</b>- Place the prepared specimen on the microscope stage. For a thorough examination of the microstructure, use the proper magnification and lighting. Take pictures or draw sketches for your documentation.<br>
11.	<b>Analysis and reporting</b>- Conduct any required measurements or analyses in accordance with the study's goals. Note down all the results, including phases, microstructural characteristics, and any anomalies.<br>
12.	<b>Preservation (optional)</b>- If the specimen needs to be preserved for an extended period, applying a protective layer (like lacquer) can be preferred to stop oxidation.
